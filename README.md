Taco's Freedom Fighters Enhanced

THis modpack is designed to extend Freedom Fighters with 3 goals in mind: 

1) Modernizing the equipment available to the player and the opfor and integrating this seamlessly into the core Freedom Fighters systems.
2) Extending gameplay with new content and mechanics that are consistent with the gameplay and atmosphere of the Freedom Fighters mod.
3) Being mindful of the overall download size in order to maintain console player accessibility. 10gb is seen as an upper overall file size limit.

Starting with the initial version I will be initially seeking to replace the RHS content with a combination of mods that integrate well while eliminating the need for the large RHS downloads. This will free up space in the budget for vehicles, weapons, clothing, or, potentially, maps.
